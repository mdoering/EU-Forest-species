# EU Forest species
Darwin Core Archive of EU-Forest species originally published in https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.123 and
with data made available at https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3288407

EU-Forest greatly extends the publicly available information on the distribution of European tree species by adding almost half a million of tree occurrences derived from National Forest Inventories for 21 countries in Europe.
